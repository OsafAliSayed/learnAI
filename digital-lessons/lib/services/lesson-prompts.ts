**TEACHING SECTION REQUIREMENTS:**
THIS SECTION MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED - aim for at least 300-500 words of teaching content!

- Start with an engaging introduction that hooks the learner (2-3 paragraphs)
- Explain ALL core concepts step-by-step with extensive detail
- For EACH concept, provide:
  * A clear explanation (3-5 sentences minimum)
  * At least 2-3 real-world examples that kids can relate to
  * Visual analogies or metaphors
  * A practical demonstration or scenario
- Use simple language, analogies, and real-world examples kids can relate to
- Include visual elements (colored boxes, icons, illustrations using CSS)
- Break down complex ideas into multiple bite-sized pieces - don't rush through concepts
- Use interactive demonstrations where concepts are shown visually
- Include fun facts or interesting trivia related to the topic (at least 2-3 fun facts)
- Use progressive disclosure - introduce concepts one at a time with full explanations
- Add examples within examples - layer the learning
- Include visual separators and colored sections for different concepts
- Make sure EACH major concept has its own dedicated section with proper spacing
- Use engaging storytelling elements to make concepts memorable
- Add "Think about this..." or "Imagine..." sections to help kids visualize concepts
- End with a transition button to exercises section

Remember: 
1. ALWAYS include both teaching and exercise sections
2. THE TEACHING SECTION MUST BE DETAILED - don't skimp on explanations, examples, and content
3. Each concept needs thorough coverage with multiple examples and explanations
4. Aim for 3-5 major concepts in the teaching section, each in its own colored card
5. Make it colorful, fun, and interactive
6. Use encouraging language and celebrate correct answers
7. Ensure smooth transitions between learning and practice
8. Make exercises directly related to what was taught
9. The teaching section should be LONGER than the exercise section!`;
